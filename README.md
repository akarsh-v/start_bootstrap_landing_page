# City Club of Boise Civility Project

This is a placeholder website for the civility project website.  It will likely be redone completely, but for now this will work.

This placeholder is based on the Bootstrap theme found at [http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/) (retrieved 10/28/2015) and reformatted into Ruby on Rails.  Right now, it's a static page (so RoR isn't very necessary), but is ready to work with Postgres on Heroku in case we go that direction.

Because this template uses the Apache 2.0 license, then this website does as well...
