# 'Landing Page' from Start Boostrap

This Ruby on Rails app is based on the Bootstrap theme found at [http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/) (retrieved 10/28/2015) and reformatted into Ruby on Rails using Haml and Sass.  Right now, it's a static page (so RoR isn't very necessary), but is ready to work with Postgres on Heroku (and assumes that Postgres is used locally but is easy to switch local developer to Sqlite3 if desired, though that's not a recommended best-practice).

## Current Status

This application is maintained by **Richard Newman**.   However, the original theme design was created and is maintained by **David Miller** (see below).   I (Richard Newman) take responsibility for any mistakes in translating his design over to Ruby on Rails and take no credit for the layout and design itself.  This was done as a quick way to apply the theme for use in a Ruby on Rails application and so only represents a translation, not an original creation.

Because this template uses the Apache 2.0 license, then this app does as well...
